This behavior also occurs when a block update is triggered. This bug was observed on a server running Minecraft Paper version 1.20.2 and the latest version of Slimefun.\r\nI demonstrated it here with Galactifun, but it happens with all addons that use blocks with physics.\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Place a Slimefun block with Falling Physics (e.g., Gravel with SLimefun Tag) on the ground.\r\n2. Observe how the Vanilla version of the block gets duplicated.\r\n(Optional)\r\n3. Trigger an update on the block.\r\n4. Observe how the Vanilla version of the block gets duplicated.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nWhen a Slimefun block with Falling Physics is placed and updated, only the Slimefun block shouldn't be affected, without duplicating the Vanilla version.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n![2024-04-14_16 22 37](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/59778169/fdddb380-fbe1-4474-84a8-c0655d9a59e7)\r\n\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\nSlimefun vDEV - 1104 (git c977454e)\n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4169","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4169/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4169/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4169/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4169","id":2235814739,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85sQgjc","number":4169,"title":"Writtenbook soulbound fix","user":{"login":"ShiftSad","id":84552713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NTUyNzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84552713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad","html_url":"https://github.com/ShiftSad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiftSad/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"‚ú® Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-04-10T14:57:34Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T23:09:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4169","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4169","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4169.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4169.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nWhen cloning an Written Book in the crafting slot with a Writable Book, it keeps all the item data, like the SoulBound Status.

Observe broken behavior (try moving the backpack item, putting disallowed items in the bag, etc)\r\n\r\n(Note it works with the slots reversed, backpack in offhand guide in main)\r\nObserve that you can drop the backpack, put anything in the backpack, etc.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI expect either the backpack to not open or if it does open to be properly recognized as a back pack and have all the correct handlers.\r\n\r\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### üìú Server Log\r\n\r\nhttps://paste.gg/p/anonymous/70c3e68a275b46ed922e5be3693a3dc6\r\n\r\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\r\n\r\n(N/A)\r\n\r\n### üíª Server Software\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\r\n\r\n1.20.x\r\n\r\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\r\n\r\nThis Server uses the following setup of Slimefun:\r\nPaper git-Paper-405 (MC: 1.20.4)\r\nSlimefun Dev - 1136\r\nMetrics-Module #29\r\nJava 17\r\nInstalled Addons: (33)\r\n  MiniBlocks vDEV - 4 (git f7a34b6e)\r\n  Networks vDEV - 50 (git 3de3c9d6)\r\n  CrystamaeHistoria vDEV - 81 (git 0c0efa95)\r\n  AureliumSkills vBeta 1.3.24\r\n  RelicsOfCthonia vDev - 12\r\n  FoxyMachines vDEV - 67 (git 0028aa93)\r\n  Quaptics vDev - 1\r\n  FNAmplifications vDev - 103\r\n  MetaBuilding v0\r\n  Furnished v1.0\r\n  MetaArrows v0\r\n  MetaRank v0.2\r\n  SlimeHUD vDev - 1\r\n  InfinityExpansion v1\r\n  SFCalc vDev - 38\r\n  Aureliumeta v0\r\n  MetaEvents v0\r\n  SlimeTinker vDEV - 84 (git 2c9f6155)\r\n  SpiritsUnchained vDev - 24\r\n  TranscEndence vDEV - 41 (git 98d7d47e)\r\n  Galactifun vDEV - 76 (git aa6414a8)\r\n  MetaStory v0\r\n  CMI v9.6.10.0\r\n  FluffyMachines vDev - 4\r\n  MetaMachines v0.7\r\n  Cultivation v1.0.0\r\n  MetaUtils v${project.version}\r\n  EcoPower vDEV - 5 (git 5c1ecd68)\r\n  MetaGuide v0\r\n  WorldEditSlimefun vUNOFFICIAL\r\n  Netheopoiesis vMODIFIED\r\n  DailyRewards v1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n  Aircraft v0\r\n\r\n### üß≠ Other plugins\r\n\r\nAfaik not related to other plugins","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4129","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4129/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4129/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4129/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4129","id":2134697464,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85m4PIC","number":4129,"title":"chore: add rc warnings to `sf versions` command","user":{"login":"ybw0014","id":7105953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDU5NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7105953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014","html_url":"https://github.com/ybw0014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ybw0014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683829434,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI5NDM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%B9%20Chores","name":"üßπ Chores","color":"7FCFBC","default":false,"description":"Refactoring / Cleanup."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2024-02-14T16:11:46Z","updated_at":"2024-02-18T00:08:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4129","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4129","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4129.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4129.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nPeople who use RC versions still report bugs to Discord/GitHub, adding warning messages may possibily stop them from reporting.

`storage.player-data`\r\n  * This accepts two values, `legacy` and `binary`\r\n  * `binary` is marked as experimental\r\n  * `legacy` is the default value for now\r\n* If `binary` (this PR) is selected in the config for player data we will show a large warning banner in the console:\r\n![experimental warning](https://i.walshy.dev/fLzZbBNbIgb2VenGW5.png)\r\n* Created a new BinaryStorage to handle writing the files as binary (more on this later)\r\n* This BinaryStorage is changing the way researches are saved, they're now using their NamespacedKey's rather than incremental IDs. This has been a change we should have made forever ago and this is step 1 to removing these number IDs.\r\n\r\n## Storage choice\r\n\r\nOk so, as you can see from the PR, the storage is done with NBT. The question I'm sure you're asking is why NBT over xyz?\r\nWell, there's a few reasons;\r\n1. Familiarity\r\n  a. Lots of server owners and developers are familiar with NBT. This makes adoption internally and externally _much_ easier (especially with how much MC has leaned into it over the years)\r\n3. Solid storage\r\n  a. NBT is about as small as it can get. Some people think it's inflated, the format isn't. Usage however is. That isn't something any format can really prevent.\r\n4. Existing tooling\r\n  a. Lots of existing tooling exists for server owners to read these files (a bit more on this later as well)\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This is a simple implementation which would have to have the whole file rewritten each time. I'll explore ways to avoid this but without limiting file size, there isn't a great way to do it.\r\n\r\n### Usage example\r\n\r\n(backpack contains 3 Slimefun items; Energized Energy Capacitor, Energized Solar Generator and a Multi Tool VII)\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 walshy  staff  3511 11 Feb 23:41 52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 3.5 KB\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches and a waypoint\r\n\r\nplayer file;\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  3511 12 Feb 00:42 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n3.5 KB\r\n\r\nwaypoint file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  110 12 Feb 00:42 data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n110 bytes\r\n\r\n**Total**: 3.6 KB\r\n\r\n#### Legacy file with all researches, a backpack and a waypoint\r\n\r\nplayer file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  8526 12 Feb 00:00 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n8.5 KB\r\n\r\nwaypoint player file:\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  110 12 Feb 00:00 data-storage/Slimefun/waypoints/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.yml\r\n```\r\n110 bytes\r\n\r\n**Total**: 8.6 KB\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches (no compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  6875 12 Feb 00:08 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 6.8 KB\r\n\r\n(this is so big because of using namespaces instead of int IDs, these take up way more space per research)\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches (gzip compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  2308 12 Feb 00:06 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 2.3 KB\r\n\r\n#### Binary file with all researches and a waypoint (gzip compression)\r\n\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--  1 walshy  staff  2457 12 Feb 00:37 data-storage/Slimefun/Players/52e0fc97-c914-4def-8899-8dbdf0c486c0.dat\r\n```\r\n**Total**: 2.4 KB\r\n\r\n**1,164 bytes** smaller than legacy, **32.1%** reduction in size\r\n(reminder that most of this space will be taken by the namespace researches -- with int IDs this would be much smaller)\r\n\r\n## Tooling\r\n\r\nI'm sure we've all used NBT programs in the past to view an NBT file, [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer) is the biggest one, there's also [NBT Studio](https://github.com/tryashtar/nbt-studio). The goal is for these programs (and others) to be able to view the files. I haven't tested this yet but I think this would be ideal.\r\n\r\nHowever, these only support the compression algorithms that MC support (gzip & zlib). I'd love to use lz4 or zstd. Luckily, MC recently announced lz4 in [snapshot 24w04a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w04a) which will be coming in 1.20.5. This hopefully means one or both of these tools update to support it.\r\nThat still doesn't mean they'd support zstd though so maybe we go lz4?\r\n\r\nSo as we stand today, we can't really go better than gzip/zlib but hopefully soon we can do lz4. Is this ok? How much should we care about existing tooling?\r\n\r\nMy goal is to avoid building our own üòÖ \r\n\r\n## For the reviewers\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n\r\n* Are we good with NBT? Any other format people _really_ want?\r\n  * If another format, why?

The first was block storage.\r\nThe second that came up was that because worlds have thousands more machines than they used to years ago, that there's too many slimefun items to get all the data saved before the server shuts down.\r\n\r\nIt's been discussed that it seems to happen a lot more often with items placed within the 10 minutes before a server restart. Unfortunately no one has been able to consistently confirm this. \r\n\r\nNetworks and IE have been the subject of this discussion quite frequently, but its because they are 2 of the most commonly used addons, however it's been brought up in the discord with core and multiple addons having this happen.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nno items should leave sf data behind after breaking  to cause this. when sf machines are mined, it should be as if nothing was ever there.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\nno error reports get generated.\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\nbeen happening for some time. \n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4107/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107","id":2092003244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85kn4uW","number":4107,"title":"Make the CropGrowthAccelerator take speed into account (grow multiple‚Ä¶","user":{"login":"pustinek","id":21089157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDg5MTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21089157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek","html_url":"https://github.com/pustinek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pustinek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"‚ú® Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2024-01-20T10:34:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-25T18:23:03Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4107","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4107.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"‚Ä¶ blocks at once)\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nThis fixes the crop growth accelerator and makes it work as is advertised. \r\nBefore it's only accelerating the growth of one block at at time instead of based on the Speed parameter of the accelerator.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nJust take into account the speed of the accelerator block\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\n<!-- Please tag any Issues related to your Pull Request -->\r\n<!-- Syntax: \"Resolves #000\" -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

Have two signed books (A and B).\r\n2. Place these blocks (listed from left to right, but placement order does not matter, appaerently):\r\n   - Chest,\r\n   - Cargo Node (Input),\r\n   - Cargo Manager\r\n   - Cargo Node (Output),\r\n   - Chest.\r\n 3. Set the Cargo Node (Input) type to Blacklist.\r\n 4. Insert the book to be copied (A) into the right (output) chest.\r\n 5. Insert the other book (B) into the left (input) chest.\r\n 6. In the right chest you will have the copied book (A) two times.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to player heads.\r\n\r\nAlso it works for higher quantities of items: for example, if you were to fill the right chest with the A books, and then proceed to insert some B books into the left chest, the item stacks in the right chest will all get eventually filled up.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you would only have 1 A book in the right chest and you were to put 17 B books into the left chest, you would end up with 16 A books and 2 B books in the right chest. So the issue is clearly **linked to incomplete item stacks**.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect the B book to transfer to the right (output) chest, instead of getting another A book.\r\n\r\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\r\n\r\nSee the bug reproduction process screencap: https://ctrlv.tv/ZLMh\r\n\r\n### üìú Server Log\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### üíª Server Software\r\n\r\nPaper\r\n\r\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\r\n\r\n1.17.x\r\n\r\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n```\r\nThis Server uses the following setup of Slimefun:\r\nPaper git-Paper-411 (MC: 1.17.1)\r\nSlimefun RC -

This applies to all the types [listed on the wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Recipe#crafting_special_*). This renders automating the crafting of items like firework rockets or dyed shulker boxes impossible.\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Create a server running just Slimefun on Paper.\r\n2. Obtain an Vanilla Auto Crafter.\r\n3. Crouch + Right Click with one of the items listed under the special crafting category.\r\n4. The Vanilla Auto Crafter will say no recipe for the item can be found.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nThe Vanilla Auto Crafter will attempt to find a recipe within reason for a given item. This would be a recipe of gunpowder and paper for a flight duration 1 explosion-less firework rocket.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n[Larger than 10mb, put on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_pRBggUAJY)\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\nhttps://pastebin.com/PpvkMTfh\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.20.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\n![image](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/98472539/0d9803f5-ef45-4b36-8c54-45e2887f3446)\r\n\n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/4018/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","id":1981405244,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85ezymk","number":4018,"title":"Add Horizontal Offset support to Holograms","user":{"login":"test137E29B","id":37277599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjc3NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37277599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B","html_url":"https://github.com/test137E29B","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/test137E29B/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2683831333,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODMxMzMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%88%20Feature","name":"üéà Feature","color":"C8E3F2","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request adds a new feature."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2023-11-07T13:48:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T15:41:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/4018","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/4018.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nHologram projectors are really nice things to use, but they lack horizontal offset support meaning any design without a central block annoyingly has an offset hologram.

Once when you put on the armor and quickly wear on a different leather armor (even custom one), it's recolored then too.

Take it off\r\n3. Quickly put on basic leather armor, it's recolored.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nDo not recolor other armors.\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/assets/75527300/2747fa92-b06d-4bb2-90ea-638b79cc5491\r\n\r\n\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nPaper\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.19.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\nSlimefun version DEV - 1087 (git dc22e665)\n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3929/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929","id":1827890358,"node_id":"PR_kwDOATMVe85WuyNC","number":3929,"title":"exploded sf blocks now drop their sf item","user":{"login":"iTwins","id":48769316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzY5MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48769316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins","html_url":"https://github.com/iTwins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iTwins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"üéØ Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."},{"id":2683827702,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjgzODI3NzAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9C%A8%20Fix","name":"‚ú® Fix","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"This Pull Request fixes an issue."},{"id":4270511434,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATMVe87-itVK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%E2%9A%A0BLOCKED","name":"‚ö†BLOCKED","color":"FF0000","default":false,"description":"This pull request is currently blocked from merging for technical reasons."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2023-07-30T10:49:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-31T09:44:10Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pulls/3929","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929","diff_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3929.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Description\r\n<!-- Please explain why you are making this pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\nSlimefun blocks didn't drop when exploded because the ``drops`` argument in ``BlockBreakHandler::onExplode`` did nothing.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n<!-- Please explain what changes you have made to the code. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n~~Pass the ``SlimefunItem`` to the ``handleEplosion`` method in ``ExplosionsListener.java`` and drop the item there.~~\r\n\r\n~~Other changes:~~\r\n~~Removed unused import.~~\r\n\r\n~~I didn't change the method signature for ``BlockBreakHandler::onExplode`` since it's a public method and that seemed like a bad idea to change.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: Changed approach completely.

Description\r\nI have recently run into an issue where a world, when created quickly enough after deletion of a world with the same name, will not store data. I have tested this extensively and narrowed the issue down to [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/tasks/TickerTask.java#L102) ticker code and [this](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/me/mrCookieSlime/Slimefun/api/BlockStorage.java#L116) check for the world's existence. Since the ticker code only runs every half second, it does not remove the world from the registry until up to a Slimefun tick later and therefore causes issues in the constructor.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to recreate this issue is to delete a world and immediately create a new one with the same name.\r\n\r\nFull credits go to @gecko10000 for some reason (my git skills most likely) his PR got closed while i tried to update it.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\nThis PR changes the registry to use UUIDs instead of the world names themselves. This _does not_ affect the storage location in files and therefore these are not breaking changes.\r\n\r\nThis may not be the ideal way to do it; it may be better to remove the world from the registry [here](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/src/main/java/io/github/thebusybiscuit/slimefun4/implementation/listeners/WorldListener.java#L28) instead.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues (if applicable)\r\nNo issue opened\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n<!-- Here is a little checklist you can follow. -->\r\n<!-- Click on these checkboxes after you created the pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Don't worry, these are not requirements.

After these problems rose, I saw in the console a message that states \"[20:15:08 ERROR]: [Slimefun] An Exception was caught while ticking the Block Tickers Task for Slimefun vDEV - 1068 (git cab97b1a)\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: World \"Teknocraft S3.5\" seems to have been deleted.

The bug is that SF electricity generators are changing to vanilla items, but all items can change this way based on the code from the error I'm posting below. \r\n\r\nPlease fix this as soon as possible, this is a very serious bug as players may start to abuse it and ask us to replace a vanilla block with an op generator, but the block was never a generator.\r\n\r\n\n\n### üìë Reproduction

Description\n\nSome days ago someone reported that they can't craft an [ElectricSpawner](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners).\r\n\r\nBoomer and I checked on this and found out that having extra NBT Tags in this case we will focused on `CustomModelData`, made the item not accepted by the recipe.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a Core Slimefun issue that is why I'm posting it here rather on [ElectricSpawners Issue](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ElectricSpawners/issues)\r\n\r\nThe item that affects with issue that we tested:\r\n- Reinforced Spawners\r\n- All vanilla item (I think this deserve they own issue, let me know if you guys need me to open one, but I will just explain it briefly below)\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Details</summary>\r\n\r\nAll vanilla items with extra

Open `item-models.yml`\r\n2. Add a value under `REINFORCED_SPAWNER`. (I'll use 1)\r\n3. Start the server\r\n4. Obtain yourself a spawner (In the video I'll be using vanilla generated spawner, spawned spawner, and soul jars)\r\n5. Repair the spawner\r\n6. Try to craft it to their ElectricSpawner type\r\n7. You can't\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\nYou should be able to craft it\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\nThe video is a little bit long, but there is timestamps to guide

The main problem I need to fix, is actually fact that players are able to enchant mmoitems witch blocked use in enchanting tables or anvils in sf autoenchanters. in. My items are blocked against enchanting but in sf you can simply bypass it. I know there's a way to add blocked lore. But what about old items without that lore? A lot of of my players using items without this lore.\r\n\r\nSo what I need to add ?\r\nEasily check stats from mmoitem and if it has blocked using in crafting, enchanting.., it won't be possible to upgrade this item. This will be probably better than using lores, because it will apply to all items no matter how old those items are.\r\n\r\nLet me know, if it is possible, thanks and have a good day!\r\n\r\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nCreate an mmoitem and block it's interaction in enchanting tables/anvils.\r\nAdd this item to slimefun autoenchanter.\r\nYou can add this item there.\r\n\r\n### üí° Expected

üìî Introduction\r\nOver the last few months and years you all have often requested for us to be more open in regards to upcoming changes.\r\nSo we decided its time to finally release a proper roadmap.\r\nNote here that this roadmap will never be complete and final, we may add or change some goals from time to time and we will refrain from setting a release date for things until absolutely certain.\r\n\r\nThis simply serves as a rough guide for you to see what changes you can be excited about.\r\nMany of those changes will likely be of technical nature though, so they may not be as exciting or intesting at first.\r\n\r\nAlso, we aren't actively looking for pull requests towards these goals unless explicitly requested.\r\nIf you wish to make a pull request, choose any open issue or approved suggestion and you are more than welcome :heart:\r\nThese changes however are mainly targeted towards the core team.\r\n\r\n## ‚≠ê Upcoming changes\r\nSome of these milestones will have a date assigned to them.\r\nBut the majority of milestones are still to far away to even have a date ready here.\r\nThose are marked as *TBD* (to be decided).\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Type of change |\r\n| :---: | :------- |\r\n| üîß | Technical change / API |\r\n| üéà | New Features |\r\n| üí° | Performance improvements |\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Older changes</summary>\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(September 3rd - 6th 2021) API relocation~~ - **DONE**\r\nThe first upcoming change is a major relocation of some of our classes to unify some packages, get rid of old classpaths and to follow the general conventions. You can read more about this here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3139\r\n\r\n### üîß ~~(Q3 2022) Updating to Java 16~~ **DONE**\r\nSlimefun will update to Java 16.\r\nThis was finished as part of: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3602\r\n\r\n### üéà~~(Q2 2023) New sound-system~~ **DONE**\r\nSoon we will allow server owners to fully configure any sound in this plugin.\r\nThis will also work with custom sounds from resource packs. Additionally, you can change the pitch and volume of any sound or even mute it.\r\nThis was finished as part of: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/2844\r\n\r\n### üéà ~~(Q3 2023) Changes to the radiation system~~ **DONE**\r\nThanks to @Semisol you will soon be able to enjoy a new radiation system which works by calculating a so-called \"exposure level\" to a radioactive substance. You won't experience radiation symptoms until a certain exposure level has been reached.\r\nThis will also make the different radiation levels much more distinct from each other and the features comes with a few good-looking UI changes too!\r\nThis was finished as part of: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/pull/3892\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### üéà (TBD) SQL database support and Research system rewrite\r\nThe Research system will be rewritten api-wise.\r\nWe will also drop numeric ids for researches and solely rely on namespaced keys.\r\nIn addition to this, we will add support for SQL databases to sync researches across multiple servers.\r\nAlternatively, a local file-based database can be used.\r\n\r\nThis is actively being done as part of the storage system rewrite.\r\nYou can track progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/docs/adr/0001-storage-layer.md#state-of-work\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) BlockStorage system rewrite\r\nThe \"block-storage\" system will be rewritten, the API will change drastically and we will open it up for much more efficient storage methods, this will do a lot in regards to stability and performance in the long-run.\r\n\r\nThis is actively being done as part of the storage system rewrite.\r\nYou can track the progress here: https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/blob/master/docs/adr/0001-storage-layer.md#state-of-work\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) Inventory system rewrite\r\nNext up is a rewrite for our inventory-system. The API is very rusty and aged. We don't have an ETA yet, perhaps closely after or along with the aforementioned API relocation.\r\nThe new system will be much more flexible and easier to use for developers.\r\n\r\n### üîß (TBD) Recipe system rewrite\r\nOur recipe system is in deep need of a rewrite, it needs to be much less item-comparison based and we should allow alternate ingredients through the use of material tags or slimefun item classes and such.\r\nI will be doing this rewrite myself and some infrastructure has been set up already but nothing to show you yet, it is still a while until we get there.\r\n\r\n### üéà (TBD) Programmable androids rewrite\r\nProgrammable androids are great.\r\nBut they can be better!

I was wondering if there is a way to unload the various slimefun blocks, instead of just saving them, as happens now.\r\n\r\nOr a help where you simply tell me mainly the classes that I should touch/look at in order to understand how to fix the problem... for now I have tried to fix the networks, I actually managed to do it, at least that's what I hoped for... but the problem persists...\r\n\r\n\r\n(I solved the problem of networks by unloading them when the world is unloaded (onWorldUnload event), using the method provided)\n\n### üìë Reproduction Steps\n\nto reproduce this problem you need 1 plugin that allows you to Unloose and load worlds (like SlimeWorld or MultiverseCore)\r\n\r\n1) at startup place slimefun blocks in a new world (not the main one!), create 1 network (cargo or Energy) and the furnaces that generate electricity (i.e. the head)\r\n\r\n2) Unload the world with /mv unload worldName or /swm unload worldName (make sure there is nobody in this world when you do these commands!)\r\n\r\n3) Wait a few minutes and reload the world with /mv load worldName or /swm load worldName.\n\n### üí° Expected Behavior\n\ndepends on what you place, I found errors in the console (in the case of the furnaces that generate electricity, due to lack of network) or simply the various blocks stop working properly (since are duplicated, or unusable due to the existence of a duplicate router)\n\n### üì∑ Screenshots / Videos\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìú Server Log\n\n_No response_\n\n### üìÇ `/error-reports/` folder\n\n_No response_\n\n### üíª Server Software\n\nYatopia\n\n### üéÆ Minecraft Version\n\n1.16.x\n\n### ‚≠ê Slimefun version\n\nI use a recoding of the v4.9 \n\n### üß≠ Other plugins\n\nAdvancedSlimeWorldManager","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/3076","id":899857016,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTk4NTcwMTY=","number":3076,"title":"Slimefun and PyroMining incompatibility ","user":{"login":"ItsSynchro","id":16171807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTcxODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16171807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsSynchro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsSynchro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2629433731,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI5NDMzNzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%8E%AF%20Needs%20testing","name":"üéØ Needs testing","color":"41CF62","default":false,"description":"This Issue needs to be tested by our team to see if it can be reproduced."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2021-05-24T17:24:36Z","updated_at":"2021-11-30T18:21:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"<!-- FILL IN THE FORM BELOW -->\r\n\r\n## :round_pushpin: Description (REQUIRED)\r\n<!-- A clear and detailed description of what went wrong. -->\r\n<!-- The more information you can provide, the easier we can handle this problem. -->\r\n<!-- Start writing below this line -->\r\n\r\nUpon using PyroMining and Slimefun, individuals are able to obtain PyroMining items if they break ores with a pickaxe that they don't have researched.

Observe how items are transferred into the destroyed Electric Furnace and are destroyed immediately afterwards as the TickerTask processes the removal of the Electric Furnace \r\n\r\nFrom my testing this is a very rare occasion, and as such a very hard bug to reproduce.\r\nHowever, with the help of a debugger which is capable of pausing the async TickerTask, it is reproducible every time\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nThe item does not transfer, or drops in the world\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n - Minecraft Version: v1_15_R1\r\n - Slimefun Version: DEV 489 (git d8964)\r\n - CS-CoreLib Version: v1.6.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121","id":204901222,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDQ5MDEyMjI=","number":121,"title":"Cargo Input Nodes don't transfer whitelisted Items if not-whitelisted items come first","user":{"login":"BlackBeltPanda","id":5866087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjYwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5866087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda","html_url":"https://github.com/BlackBeltPanda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlackBeltPanda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":499484638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTk0ODQ2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%90%9E%20Bug%20Report","name":"üêû Bug Report","color":"d73f1f","default":false,"description":"A bug that needs to be fixed."},{"id":2642156940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjQyMTU2OTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/labels/%F0%9F%A7%A8%20Confirmed%20Bug","name":"üß® Confirmed Bug","color":"B3EFFA","default":false,"description":"This bug has been confirmed by our team."}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2017-02-02T15:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-02-09T02:49:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"## Description\r\nWith an Input Node in Blacklist mode and no items blacklisted, connected to a chest with an Advanced Output Node with an item whitelisted, if any items are blocking the slots before the whitelisted item in the input chest with nowhere to go, the whitelisted item never gets transported.\r\n\r\n## Evidence / Proof\r\nGIF: https://i.gyazo.com/7199e6c7f7e7f173fa3c7f1dfa778efc.gif\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nMC version: 1.11.2 (git-Paper-1032)\r\nCS-CoreLib version: 1.5.12\r\nSlimefun version: 4.1.1\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Slimefun/Slimefun4/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]
